#  Returns the screen (pixel based) coordinates of some (x, y) graph location base on configuration
#
#  Parameters:
#   xo, yo : the pixel location of the origin of the  graph
#   ratio: the ratio of pixels to single step in graph (i.e 1 step is ratio amount of pixels)
#   x, y: the graph location to change into a screen (pixel-based) location
#
#  Usage -> screenCoor(xo, yo, ratio, 1, 0)
#
#  Returns: (screenX, screenY) which is the graph location (x,y) as a pixel location in the window
#
def screenCoor(xo, yo, ratio, x, y):

#
#  Returns a string of the colour to use for the current expression being drawn
#  This colour is chosen based on which how many expression have previously been drawn
#  The counter starts at 0, the first or 0th expression, should be red, the second green, the third blue
#  then loops back to red, then green, then blue, again
#
#  Usage -> getColor(counter)
#
#  Parameters:
#  counter: an integer where the value is a count (starting at 0) of the expressions drawn
#
#  Returns: 0 -> "red", 1 -> "green", 2 -> "blue", 3 -> "red", 4 -> "green", etc.

#
#  Draw in the window an xaxis label (text) for a point at (screenX, screenY)
#  the actual drawing points will be offset from this location as necessary
#  Ex. for (x,y) = (1,0) or x-axis tick/label spot 1, draw a tick mark and the label 1
#
#  Usage -> drawXAxisLabelTick(pointer, 1, 0, "1")
#
#  Parameters:
#  pointer: the turtle drawing object
#  screenX, screenY): the pixel screen location to drawn the label and tick mark for
#  text: the text of the label to draw
#
#  Returns: Nothing

#
#  Draw in the window an yaxis label (text) for a point at (screenX, screenY)
#  the actual drawing points will be offset from this location as necessary
#  Ex. for (x,y) = (0,1) or y-axis tick/label spot 1, draw a tick mark and the label 1
#
#  Usage -> drawXAxisLabelTick(pointer, 0, 1, "1")
#
#  Parameters:
#  pointer: the turtle drawing object
#  screenX, screenY): the pixel screen location to drawn the label and tick mark for
#  text: the text of the label to draw
#
#  Returns: Nothing

#  Draw in the window an xaxis (secondary function is to return the minimum and maximum graph locations drawn at)

#  Usage -> drawXAxis(pointer, xo, yo, ratio)
#
#  Parameters:
#  pointer: the turtle drawing object
#  xo, yo : the pixel location of the origin of the  graph
#  ratio: the ratio of pixels to single step in graph (i.e 1 step is ratio amount of pixels)
#
#  Returns: (xmin, ymin) where xmin is minimum x location drawn at and xmax is maximum x location drawn at

#  Usage -> drawYAxis(pointer, xo, yo, ratio)
#
#  Parameters:
#  pointer: the turtle drawing object
#  xo, yo : the pixel location of the origin of the  graph
#  ratio: the ratio of pixels to single step in graph (i.e 1 step is ratio amount of pixels)
#
#  Returns: Nothing

#
#  Draw in the window the given expression (expr) between [xmin, xmax] graph locations
#
#  Usage -> drawExpr(pointer, xo, yo, ratio, xmin, xmax, expr)
#
#  Parameters:
#  pointer: the turtle drawing object
#  xo, yo : the pixel location of the origin of the  graph
#  ratio: the ratio of pixels to single step in graph (i.e 1 step is ratio amount of pixels)
#  expr: the expression to draw (assumed to be valid)
#  xmin, ymin : the range for which to draw the expression [xmin, xmax]
